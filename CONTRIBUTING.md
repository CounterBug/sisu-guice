# How to contribute #

This is a patched build of https://github.com/google/guice/ which includes selected contributions that have not yet been merged into the upstream build.

While we will consider pull-requests (Apache 2.0 licensed) it is better to send contributions directly to the upstream project. You can then open an issue here if you would like specific upstream contributions added to sisu-guice and made available in a release outside of the current google/guice schedule.
